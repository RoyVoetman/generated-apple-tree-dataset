# Annotation format

For each image, there is a txt file with the same name where each row indicates a distinct bounding box.

These annotations conform to the YOLO Ultralytics annotation format as described: [https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/train_custom_data/#12-create-labels_1](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/train_custom_data/#12-create-labels_1) which specifies the "class x_center y_center width height" format with relative coordinates.
